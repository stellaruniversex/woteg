-- FOSSIL FUELS AND "NATURAL" SOURCES --
The first sources of fuel used by humans was biomass, in the form of fire. This could be used to generate heat, cook food, and later run basic machines, which powered the Industrial Revolution. It is believed that fire was the biggest invention of mankind until the discovery of FTL travel.  

- Coal, oil and gas -
The population growth caused by the Industrial Revolution led to the destruction of millions of trees, threatening forests all across Dacanium and the Eastern Lands. This largely stopped with the mining of coal in the 19th century, which was more energy-dense and sometimes cleaner, powering the gigantic factories of the Industrial Revolution.

However, coal had problems: it was still dirty and couldn't be transported as easily as a liquid. In the late 19th century, petroleum was discovered in Thalgavar, and soon in many other places. Oil had several advantages over coal, being cleaner, even more energy-dense, and processable into hundreds of different materials.

Coal and oil were eventually joined by natural gas, with the discovery of the Ustara natural gas field in 1902, kickstarting the usage of gas for heating and power generation. The Ustara field remains the largest natural gas reserve even today.

- Renewables -
The most popular forms of renewable power (solar and wind) actually date back to the late Industrial Age in the late 19th century, but serious money into their research was not invested until the 1950s, in response to a looming climate crisis with the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels. Renewables eventually became a competitor against nuclear, being favored by those who prefered a world where humanity lived in harmony with nature, in comparison to nuclear advocates who prefered a world of cheap energy and unlimited abundance. All illusions of "living in harmony" were destroyed the moment the first solar panels were installed in the early 1960s.

In pursuit of this admirable goal, thousands of square kilometers of prime farmland and millennia-old forests were destroyed to build solar panels and wind turbines, leading to fierce resistance from local residents that stopped many projects. The final event that effectively killed solar and wind deployment was the dumping of solar panels, destroyed in a storm, into Lake Belem in 1978. While the water was eventually decontaminated, the toxic waste generated by dead solar panels destroyed public perception, and soon wind was also struck by the PR nuclear bomb.

Solar panels remained in use in spacecraft, being used for expeditions headed for the inner solar system, and are still used for small-scale spacecraft, for which installation of a nuclear reactor or RTG would be impractical or physically impossible.

Today, most solar and wind installations are in remote areas where nuclear power is impractical, in temporary outposts, and in new colonies as a quickly installable power source before a nuclear reactor is constructed.

-- NUCLEAR FISSION --
In the mid-1940s, the first commercial nuclear reactors were built in Frosthaven, using the nearly unlimited energy of nuclear fission for energy. All nuclear fission reactors have one thing in common - they use the heat of nuclear fission to generate steam, powering massive turbines. Despite the multiple steps involved, the conversion efficiency in the most modern plants is over 70% thermal to electric.

-- NUCLEAR FUSION --
Nuclear fusion is the primary method for energy generation currently, it works by fusing hydrogen or deuterium with tritium or helium-3, though other fusion methods have also been proven to work. The plasma is either contained inside a magnetic containment field (tokamak), contained with external magnets (stellarator), or by inducing an inherent anti-magnetic field in the plasma (magnetolumin).

-- ANTIMATTER REACTION --

-- ZERO-POINT ENERGY --
Zero-point energy, or vacuum energy, is a hypothetical method of energy generation that would extract nearly infinite amounts of energy from the vacuum of space, using quantum-dynamic methods to harness it within a particular area. The mechanics for extracting this kind of energy are unknown, even the Second Empire did not know how to do so.
