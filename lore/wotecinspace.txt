WotEG: War of the Eight Galaxies - "Like WotEC, but in SPACE!" - Valixor, 2022
start date/milleu: 12 November 32108 CE (684 TE - after the founding of the (Third) Empire)

-- really 32108 CE? --

according to a very widespread conspiracy theory, the galaxy isn't *that* old, and 23,000 years have been added by the Khaldaarim (15,000 years) and the Third Empire (8,000 years) to allow them to fabricate incredibly long and impressive lists of powerful leaders and spread false legends about them. according to the conspiracy, the Second Empire only lasted for 3,976 years ("3650"-"7626 CE", the Interregnum only lasted for 500 years, and the gap between the end of the Second Empire ("7626 CE") and the founding of the Third Empire ("8424 CE") is only 798 years, not over 4,800 years as claimed by official histories.

they cite the Third Empire's irrational ban on carbon-14 dating as proof of the coverup, noting that other dating measurements are allowed, as long as they're ambiguous enough to give an uncertainty that would corroborate the fabricated dates.

-- Sector, System and Planet Generation --

sectors: sectors range from 00-00-00 to 99-99-99, with Dahanno as 50-50-50. each sector is 100 light years across, containing around 2,000 stars on average. there are 1,000,000 sectors and 1,920,000,000 stars in the charted sectors, but some are known beyond this region, stars located in at least one negative sector number have the hyphen before the number changed to a plus, while those in sector num 100+ (or <-100) use 3 or even 4 digits (R136a1 is somewhere around S+1200+1200-800). for actual tabletop gameplay consider getting rid of the third dimension to make it a 2D plane (any stars at the same XY sector coordinates as the sector of the most populous star system will be destroyed, unfortunately), in this setup the known galaxy has around 3,000,000 star systems

the Milky Way has 1,767,146 sectors, 482,854 sectors are outside the circle and are intergalactic, 125,663 are in the Inner Rim and 31,416 are in the Core, rest are in the Middle Rim, there are 640,099,300 accessible star systems in the Milky Way, of those 483,020,100 are in the Middle and Outer Rim, 100,530,400 in the Inner Rim and 56,548,800 are in the Core.
384,059,580 have 1 star - total 384,059,580 stars
128,019,860 have 2 stars - total 256,039,720 stars
64,009,930 have 3 stars - total 192,029,790 stars
32,004,965 have 4 stars - total 128,019,860 stars
28,804,469 have 5 stars - total 144,022,345 stars
2,880,446 have 6 stars - total 17,282,676 stars
320,050 have 7 stars - total 2,240,350 stars
for a total of 1,123,694,321 accessible stars in the Milky Way
such a number of stars cannot be easily stored on a regular computer (roughly 250 GB for a Milky-Way sized galaxy), so they need to be procedurally generated, with only a small part of the galaxy saved at any time (Minecraft style), storing a full galaxy is best suited for a server, I'll try to make a compression algorithm...

galactic sectors: rarely used for actual navigation (only UFOs from other galaxies go that far), each sector is a 1,000,000 ly cube, usually containing a handful of galaxies. they are labelled G-xx-yy-zz-nn, where xx, yy and zz are sector numbers and nn is galaxy number. this system can resolve galaxies in a volume 100,000,000 ly across. galactocentric stellar sectors originate from the origin point, which is S-5000-5000-5000, and need not be at the center of any galaxy (indeed they are usually in the intergalactic void). this is even more rarely extended to 4 or 5 digits, allowing areas of 100 billion ly (~ diameter of observable universe) to be resolved, but things become meaningless as nothing can travel across such distant galaxies yet. for actual tabletop gameplay consider getting rid of the third sector to make it a 2D plane

universal sectors: why? WotEG isn't meant to work in whole *universes*! anyway, it would be defined the same as stellar and galactic sectors, but with a U at the start, e.g. U-50-50(-50), with no number after, as there's generally less than 1 universe per universal sector. locations inside a universal sector are defined using a 5-digit galactic sector location, in turn defined with a 4-digit stellar sector location. this could resolve areas of 10 *trillion* lightyears, but no computer in the near future can run the calculations needed for a full universal adventure, so whatever!

naming: if star is A-class and smaller, has no planets and no significant features, use a generic classification S-xx-yy-zz-nnnn, where xx-yy-zz is the sector (100 light years cube), The One (Dahanno) is S-50-50-50-0001, in Federation of Dahanno territory
if star is B-class and larger, it may be named after a divine or a concept. Deneb, in neutral territory, S+10-87-106-0007 is such a star (A2 Ia, age 10) (near Sol - S+18-80-90-0001, in neutral territory)
if star has no planets but at least 1 significant feature, both the star system and feature is given the name of a natural feature, a major person or a property of the feature, in one of the common languages of the sector. Thalyana (Waste Star), near the edge of Stellar Republic of Caranetia, S-32-12-90-0133 is such a star (K6 V, age 8), with a now-inhabited ring of once-abandoned orbital habitats.
if star is F-class and smaller, and has planets, but no inhabited and/or life bearing ones, and no special features, use a generic classification S-xx-yy-zz-nnnn, where xx-yy-zz is the sector (100 light years cube), e.g. S-76-26-34-0063 (M3 V, age 2) with 7 planets (3 terrestrial, all uninhabited and 4 gas giants, with no interesting moons), in Empire of Khaldaar territory

-- parsec revision! --

another way of defining stellar locations is to use parsecs instead, so there are 900 locations per sector. in this setup, there are 1,500,000 star systems in the known galaxy, and 561,847,160 stars in the Milky Way (1/2 as many, this significantly speeds up computation alone!), their population is doubled to compensate

this means 1/10th (maybe 1/100th due to more efficient n^2 functions) as much computation *and* less empty space, but means locations less distant than 1 parsec (3.26 ly) will get destroyed, with only the most populous star system surviving

-- star systems, finally! --

for each sector, every light year roll a d100 (or 2 d10s, treating 1 as 0, and adding 1) to determine if a star system should be generated, if using 3d model: if sector is in the Middle or Outer Rim - d100 = 1, if sector is in Inner Rim - d100 = 1-2, if sector is in Core - d100 = 1-5
if using 2d model: if sector is in Middle or Outer Rim - d100 = 1-3, if sector is in Inner Rim - d100 = 1-8, if sector is in Core - d100 = 1-18. the vanila WotEG area is in the Middle Rim, bordering on the Inner Rim

if the sector is intergalactic, use a different method to determine number of star systems, roll a d20 to determine number of stars in sector, there are 5,069,967 star systems in the intergalactic sectors of the Milky Way

usage: really, use a generator program to generate your solar systems, this is quite complicated

units: all units are in metric (m - meters, km - kilometers, Mm - megameters (1000 km)) or SI (K - Kelvin (Â°C - 273.15))! (no inconvenient conversion factors please, thank you)

there are 8 edge stars: -  - S-00-00-00-0001
- S-99-00-00-0001
- S-00-99-00-0001
- S-00-00-99-0001
- S-99-99-00-0001
- S-99-00-99-0001
- S-00-99-99-0001
- S-99-99-99-0001
or 4 edge stars in 2D:
- S-99-00-0001 (Alpha Point)
- S-99-99-0001 (Beta Point)
- S-00-00-0001 (Gamma Point)
- S-00-99-0001 (Delta Point), all in neutral territory

roll D100 (or 2 D10s, treating 1-10 as 0-9) to get star classification (mostly realistic, but skewed to give more larger stars)
1 - O-class
2-3 - B-class
4-6 - A-class
7-10 - F-class
11-20 - G-class
21-40 - K-class
41-100 - M-class

then roll D20 to determine star count,
1-12 - 1 star
13-16 - 2 stars
17-18 - 3 stars
19 - 4 stars
20 - 5+ stars
if dice roll is 20, roll a D10, add 1 star if roll is 10 and continue, else end roll

for each companion star, roll the same D100 to get star class, discard and roll again if star class is higher than main star, age is same as main star
then roll D2 to determine if first companion is a close or distant binary, all others are distant, with their own solar systems

next, roll D12 to determine star age:
G, K and M classes: 1 billion years/point
F-class: 500 million years/point
A-class: 100 million years/point
B-class: 20 million years/point
O-class: 10 million years/point

then lookup these tables that determines diameter (in x100 Mm or x100,000km), based on age:
    1     2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12

O |300 |360 |450 |600 |800 |1100|1400|1800|2500|4000|8000|9999| - 30 M-sun (12 age O-class star is 1,600,000,000 km in diameter, and more of a M-class supergiant)
B |180 |220 |270 |350 |480 |650 |900 |1200|1800|3000|6500|8000| - 10 M-sun

  -------------------------------------------------------------
(Sol is a 5 age G-class star)

which gives us the minimum orbit distance:

  -------------------------------------------------------------

if planet is O-class, roll d20 to determine special type:

1-12 - normal O-class star (temp +4)
13-15 - luminous variable (temp +5)
16-17 - Wolf-Rayet star (temp +7)
18 - helium-carbon star (temp +5)
19 - pulsating O-class star (temp +5)
20 - carbon star (temp +5)

below is important for hyperlane generation:
O-class stars are the most powerful known natural hyperlane generators, branching to all other O-class stars within 250 ly and one B-class star
B-class stars branch to any other B-class star connected to an O-class star (directly or indirectly), as well as one A-class star
A-class stars branch to any other A-class star connected to an B-class star (directly or indirectly), as well as one F-class star
F-class stars branch to any other F-class star connected to an A-class star (directly or indirectly), as well as one G-class star
and so on until M-class:
M-class stars branch to any other M-class star connected to an K-class star (directly or indirectly)

(tidal locking or really at what timespan it happens is *really* poorly understood, assume initial rotation period is 8 h, 0.000218 r/s, or 218 microradians per second)

t_lock ~= 4.5*(a^6*R*mu)/(m_s*m_p^2)*10^10 y, take 3*10^10 N*m^-2 if planet is >50% rocky, 4*10^9 N*m^-2 if planet is >50% icy

expected tidal-lock time for Earth ~= 4.5*((1.49*10^11 m)^6*6.371*10^6 m*3*10^10 N*m^-2)/(1.99*10^30*(5.972*10^24)^2) * 10^10 ~= 1,327,000,000,000,000 years ~= 1.327 quadrillion years
yeah, don't bother with the boring calculations, just lookup another table that tells what's the smallest rocky and icy planet respectively (size in x1000 km) that will get tidal-locked at 5 billion years
(insert table here)
    1
  ----
O | X|
B |
A |
F |
G |
K |
M |
actually don't bother with tidal locking at all, just leave it to a diceroll: D20-2*d+c (d = distance given below, c = star class, M is 0, O is +6)

do the tidal lock check if:
M-class: d < 5
K-class: d < 5
G-class: d < 6
F-class: d < 7
A-class: d < 8
B-class: d < 9
O-class: d < 10

if the modified roll is >10, then planet is tidal-locked, between 8-9 it is spin-locked (partial tidal locking), if planet is tidal locked then habitable area is reduced by 70%

roll D12 to determine planet number, then add/subtract modifer based on star class:
-4 for O-class
-3 for B-class
-2 for A-class
-1 for F-class
0 for G-class
+1 for K-class
+2 for M-class
roll D20 to determine distance from star (if planet is within 110% of star diameter, discard and roll again)

planet distance: roll a D20 to determine, if same as another planet discard and roll again
K-class stars cannot have planets at more than 19 distance, M-class at more than 18, if >19 & >18 respectively discard and roll again

planet type: roll a D20
1-5 - iron-silicate terrestrial planet (5000 kg/m^3, +0 to mass)
6-9 - silicate terrestrial planet (3000 kg/m^3 -1 to mass)
10-11 - iron terrestrial planet (8000 kg/m^3, +1 to mass)
12-13 - icy terrestrial planet (1500 kg/m^3, -3 to mass, -2 to temp), if t > 9 a waterworld (water level 20), with exotic ice forming the "surface"
14-20 - gas planet

if planet is terrestrial: roll a d20 to determine diameter, 1 = 1000 km, 20 = 20000 km

if planet is gaseous: roll a d20 to determine diameter, 1 = 10000 km, 20 = 200000 km

(d = diameter)

terrestrial mass = d+planet type:

1 - <0.05 Earth (-6 water level)
2 - <0.05-0.12 Earth (-5 water level)

18 - 4.2-5 Earth (+4 water level)
19 - 5-6 Earth (+4 water level)
20 - >6 Earth (+5 water level)

for terrestrial planets, roll d6 to determine number of major moons:
1-3 - no major moons
4-5 - 1 major moon
6 - 2+ major moons
if a 6 is rolled, keep rolling a d6, if 6 is rolled add another moon, otherwise end roll
fallback (very unlikely to be needed): if all orbital slots are filled, stop rolling!

a moon around a terrestrial planet cannot have more than m-12 (m is planet mass) after accounting for moon composition, if m is 9, 10, 11 or 12 max moon mass is 1, they also receive no tidal heating (they'd be ripped apart at a point where they receive significant tidal heating)
the moon distance is the distance for moons around gaseous planets, divided by 10 (Moon/Luna orbits Earth at distance 11 (384,000 km)
if a major moon is orbiting a planet, any tidal locking modifiers are ignored, and the planet day is equal to the first moon's orbital period

terrestrial mass and gravity = d-2+planet type if size - 11-13, d-1+planet type if 8-10 or 14+, d+planet type if <8, 1 = 0.1 g, 20 = 2 g
for gravity below 10, general build cost decreases by 5%, for gravity above 10, general build cost increases by 10%

20 - >6 Jupiter (+10 tidal heating)

for gaseous planets, roll d8-1 to determine number of major moons, 0 means no major moons, 7 means 7 major moons, do the calculations for all of them
maximum moon diameter is gaseous mass - 2 (m_g-2), a Jupiter-sized (14) gas planet cannot have a planet larger than 12,000 km, if moon diameter is larger than the limit discard and roll again

moon distance: roll a D20 to determine, if same as another major moon discard and roll again
gravity well does not allow moons to orbit at a distance of more than m+4 (gaseous planet mass), for a Jupiter-sized planet 18 - 30,000,000 km
1 - 150K-250K km
2 - 250K-350K km

19 - 30-50M km
20 - >50M km

base temperature (t_base) is 16+r_s+s_m-dist+p_type, r_s is the minimum orbit distance the star reaches (for The One/Dahanno - 0, UY Scuti - 14), s_m is the extra heat due to high luminosity, p_type is planet type (albedo), add tidal heating (t_tid-d) if a moon. if t < 0 after all modifiers then t = 0, if t > 20 then the temperature is 750+(t-20)*5, eg. t = 25 -> 750+(25-20)*150 = 1500 K

temperature:
1 - 0-45 K, life -3
2 - 45-77 K, life -3
3 - 77-100 K, life -3
4 - 100-125 K, life -3

18 - 575-650 K, life -5
19 - 650-750 K, life -6
20 - >750 K, life -7
temperatures between 9 and 11 are habitable for human and elven people without any modification, between 8 and 12 with slight planetary modification (extra CO2, sunshields etc.), Earth is temp 10, Venus is temp 19, Mars is temp 7
if temperature after all modifiers is >24 (>1350 K), then life (even complex life!!!) can appear in molten silicon, temperature-induced life modifier in that case is +0

there is a chance that the planet has undergone runaway greenhouse effect, roll a d20, modified by (t_b-10)+(atm-10) (t_b - effective temperature, atm - atmospheric pressure). if value is >12, then the planet's temperature is increased by 10
if planet has CO2 atmosphere and 14+ pressure, as well as base temperature of 300K and above, it undergoes runaway greenhouse effect regardless of roll, increasing temperature to either 18 (if t_base = 250-300K), 19 (if t_base = 300-400K), or 20 (if t_base > 400K)
if t < 9, the planet may still have a subglacial ocean, roll d10+t, if roll >= 10 then planet has a subglacial ocean (max life level 10), otherwise planet is completely frozen (max life level 6), neither case requires an atmosphere (Europa has a subglacial ocean)

atmospheric pressure is determined by d20+grav-10, with a maximum of m*2, where m is planet mass

atmospheric pressure:
1 - <0.05 atm
2 - 0.05-0.15 atm
3 - 0.15-0.25 atm
4 - 0.25-0.325 atm

18 - 8-12 atm (temp +2)
19 - 12-50 atm (temp +3)
20 - 50-70 atm (temp +4)

above 20, atmosphere is 50+(atm-20)*20, Venus is atm 23 (92 atm)

final temperature, if no runaway heating occurs, is t_base+t_atm.

if the planet *should* have water but atm = 1, then check t_base: if t < 9 then planet may have a subglacial ocean, if t > 9 then water sublimates, creating an atmosphere with water vapor as its main component. as a very good greenhouse gas, the roll to check for runaway heating increases by 5

if planet is lifeless and atmosphere >1, roll d6 to determine (highly toxic) atmosphere:
1 - CO2
2 - methane
3 - sulfur dioxide
4 - chlorine
5 - nitrogen oxides
6 - hydrocarbon

if planet is very cold, these are the gases that make up the atmosphere
t = 1-3 - hydrogen
t = 4 - nitrogen, methane

if planet has life, the atmosphere depends on the base substance used:
water (common) - nitrogen-oxygen, argon-oxygen or carbon-oxygen (CO2 > O2) (life level +2), possible if atm > 1 and t = 8-13
CO2 (uncommon) - carbon-oxygen (CO2 synthesized into carbon and oxygen) (life level +0), possible if atm = 17-20 and t = 7-8
methane (uncommon) - hydrogen-carbon (carbon absorbed by life) (life level +0), possible if t = 3-4
molten silicon! (*very* rare) - silicon-oxygen (gaseous ROCK, nice) (life level -1), possible if t >= 24 (1350 K)

water: d12+p_modifier+t_modifier-2, p_modifier is change in water level based on planet mass, t_modifier is change in water level based on temperature

19 - 100% water, min depth 20 km
20 - 100% water, min depth 30 km

water levels are determined by atmospheric pressure and temperature, maximum total temperature at which water can exist under standard pressure. if water doesn't boil at that temperature, each 2 levels of temperature above 10 reduce water level by 1. if no liquids can exist at the given temperature, planet contains no subglacial oceans or even just no planet-wide glaciers, life level is locked to 0

higher temperature decreases water level due to high evaporation, if water level is <1 after modifiers, then water level is locked to 1

intelligent life appears only in certain circumstances, if life roll is >16, roll a d6, if dice roll is 1-2, life level can be between 17-20, else it is locked to 16

if a native civilization exists on the planet, roll d6 to determine dominant species (cosmetic only):

if tech level is 9 (Modern Age), civilization has 10% chance (10 on a d10) to have a spacecraft in space, if tech level is 10, civilization has spacecraft in space and 50% chance (6-10 on a d10) to have a minor base on the closest planet (by distance, prioritize furthest if two exist 1 distance level apart from main planet) with temperature <= 15, if tech level is 11, civilization has spacecraft in space, a minor base on the closest planet (more distant planet goes first) with temperature <= 15, and up to (and including) d6-1 additional minor bases on planets with temperature <= 15, if not enough suitable planets exist then the number is the amount of suitable planets, if tech level is 12, civilization has colonies with 7 population (10s of millions) on d6 additional star systems, each on one planet, if d6 roll is 6 then planet is terraformed to temperature, pressure and atmosphere of the main planet

-- Ancient Artifacts --

between sectors 50-9 and 53-13, there is an area of largely untouched arcane structures built during the Second Empire, with tech level believed to be between 24 and 26 (maximum in known galaxy is 18). a large number of these structures are defensive systems that have gone rogue in the years after the Second Empire's collapse, making entry into any part of these sectors extremely dangerous.

for every star system in this sector, roll a d20 to determine what kind of ancient artifact will be generated:

1-10 - nothing
11-13 - starlifting mine (increases tech level in capital by one-time 1 level, up to 22, can be repaired at tech 19 to a functioning starlifter)
14-16 - solar habitat (can be repaired at tech 19 to a functioning partial habitat, and fully rebuilt at tech 22, 2 tech levels lower than normal)
17-20 - rogue defensive system (star system outfitted with Antimatter Missile, all types of anti-FTL devices, Antimatter Gun, Space Fort IV and Planetary Shield Network on all planets, as well as Hawking Cannons in the entire inner solar system. if civilization defeats this system it will receive level 20, or 2 tech levels increase whichever results in higher final level, up to 28, military tech)

-- Item rarity --

Common (current tech) - most items are of this rarity, no special modifiers
Legendary (early post-Imperial) - a highly valuable, powerful item (tech 20-24) made from the scavenged remnants of Second Empire vehicles and buildings, featuring some of the technologies available in the Second Empire.
Legendary (Second Empire) - a highly valuable, powerful item (tech 23-28) from the last years of the Second Empire. items taken from Ancient Artifacts are at least of this rarity
Mythic (Second Empire) - an extremely valuable item (tech 17-22) from the early Second Empire.
Mythic (Interregnum) - an extremely valuable item (tech 12-16) from the incredibly long period of chaos and disorder lasting between the First Empire's collapse in 3150 CE and 250 SE (21575 CE), when the Empire of the Stars (Second Empire) began stabilizing the region. endless conflict, constant invasions from outside the Known Galaxy and natural catastrophes prevented any advancement, until a lucky series of events around 21000 CE created the conditions for the formation of a long-lived state.
Mythic (early Interregnum) - an insanely valuable item (tech 12-16) from the early Interregnum, to around 4500 CE, when memories of the First Empire were still vivid and numerous pretenders tried to restore it, none successfully.
Mythic (First Empire) - an insanely valuable item (tech 12-16) that has survived intact from the First Empire (2396-3150 CE), mostly aesthetic rather than functional (First Empire tech was max 16), these items can fetch over $1 billion at auction
Mythic (pre-Imperial) - an insanely valuable item (tech 12-15) from the non-human empires that inhabited (and still inhabit to some degree) before the First Empire, around 2500 BCE (Old Balanic Empire) to 2000 CE (Second Great War)
Ultimate (pre-Imperial) - an unfathomably valuable item (tech 12-16) from the palaces of pre-First Empire states, 3 of the 12 Heaven Jewels have been found as of 32108, the others are still scattered in the territory of the former Second Empire.
Ultimate (Ancient Realm) - an unfathomably valuable and powerful item (tech 22-30) from the elven Ancient Realm (Cala Alathya), around 10,000 BCE to 2500 BCE.
Ultimate (Second Empire) - the Shatterer of Realms (tech 29?), a superweapon of untold power described in surviving Imperial mythology, believed to be around sector 205+80 (x=205, y=-80) with a 30-sector (3,000 ly) uncertainty.
Ultimate (The Toreaanet) - an unfathomably valuable item (tech 18-23) from the Stellar Toreaanet, which is believed to have existed from 28,000 BCE, to 2446 CE when it was conquered by the First Empire and allies. due to their usefulness as wormhole stabilizers for the Second Empire during the Wormhole Age, only a handful of Toreaanet items are left in remote areas
Divine (Kingdom of the Dawn) - an item (tech ??) from the Kingdom of the Dawn, a galaxy-spanning empire with unknown origin that ceased existing before 34,000 BCE. no items of this rarity have yet been found despite extensive searches, and only a survey for their potential signals have given any clues as to where their capital was (x=554, y=125, with a 300-sector uncertainty)

-- Spacecraft Travel --

interstellar travel is done using warp drives, hyperlane drives, jump drives or wormholes. warp drives are the most flexible and most scalable (used in everything from personal jetpacks to the largest dreadnoughts), but also the slowest for now, hyperlane drives are fast, but are locked to hyperspace lanes, jump drives are extremely fast, but extremely expensive, take a long time to recharge and demand huge amounts of energy, and wormholes have unlimited speed (capable of travelling even trillions of light years!!!), but are very difficult to deploy, extremely expensive and can only travel between two destinations

tech notes below:
Sentient Age refers to highly aware computers, with multi-dimensional thought. AGI was perfected long ago, in the early Warp Age
Stellar Age refers to the beginning of star exploitation, with limited starlifting used to generate large resource quantities
Mega(structure) Age refers to the extensive construction of large-scale structures, such as shellworlds and planetary refineries, towards the end of stellar-scale structures such as Dyson swarms (true Dyson spheres aren't possible until Tech 32)
Vacuum Age refers to the discovery of economical vacuum energy extraction, which can be used to power extremely powerful FTL drives

powers of c (speed of light) - various measurements previously, now standardized to 6^n-1 c, where n is tier of FTL drive
e.g. tier 5-2 (the galactic standard in 32108) FTL drive is 6^(5-1) * 2 = 2592 c, tier 6-5 (cutting-edge limit in 32108) FTL drive is 6^(6-1)*5 = 38,880 c (rounded up to 39K c normally)
also given is the time needed to cross the Milky Way (150,000 lightyears) with the most powerful drive of that tier at a constant rate (not applicable in reality, especially for hyperlane and jump drives; hyperlane drives often need to take circuitous routes, current jump drives take weeks to recharge (the Khaldaarim Yonthil-class cruiser/tech 18 takes just 6 days to recharge))
after tech 23 or so, the average FTL drive begins to lag from the most advanced drives by about 1 tier, due to increasing expenses, after tech 31 by 2 tiers, tech 38 by 3 tiers
everything above Tech 29 (Second Empire max) is extrapolated based on expected trends
if a warp field is disrupted by a sufficiently strong gravitational force (i.e. neutron stars or black holes) the consequences of an FTL spacecraft being outside a warp bubble create a black hole equal to the mass of the spacecraft, which violently explodes after some time (8 hours for an Interexp-class, 402.6 days for an Arayel-class)

the most advanced FTL drive in use in major states is Warp 5-6 (20 years) and Jump 1-2 (10 years), both available at tech 16, across the Known Galaxy as of 32108, the most advanced FTL drive in use (tech 18) is Hyperlane 3-1 (3.2 years), Warp 6-5 (3.86 years) and Jump 2-3 (1.07 years). the most advanced FTL drive used by the Second Empire (27301) was Hyperlane 6-2 (2.7 days), Warp 9-3 (10.8 days), Jump 6-3 (7.2 hours) and Wormhole 5-1 (36 minutes, but *very* difficult to build)

wormholes are the only exception to the tier 20 FTL limit, after Tech 46, every 3 tech levels a higher tier of wormholes is developed, the highest possible before Beyond is Wormhole 18, at FTL tier 26 and Tech Level 64, in the Age of Ascension, capable of crossing 5.4 trillion light years per second (170,581,728,179,578,208,256 c). such a civilization would likely also be using even more advanced methods of travel, still unknown to current science, and it is also believed wormholes would also be much easier to make than they were during the Second Empire.

in the late Universal Age (tech 56), jump drives take just 4 hours to recharge and can traverse roughly 5 billion lightyears, empire size may be around 2 weeks jump travel, i.e. 2*420,000M lightyears = 840,000M lightyears in max diameter, covering around 1.5 quadrillion galaxies with 1.5 septillion stars, all covered with Dyson spheres and Birch planets to make a Kardashev IV+ civilization with a population of >10^46 people
2.356*10^44 - population on Birch planets
2.121*10^46 - population on Dyson spheres

-- Sphere of Influence --
related to the above as it depends on the FTL drive and the tier-level.

the maximum reach of direct control that a civilization can exert effectively is equal to 120 days one-way distance (240 days round-trip) from the capital to the sector center, with the fastest FTL drive available to the civilization that is of the most common type used (if the most common FTL drive is warp, then the highest warp drive will be considered, if jump, then the highest jump drive will be considered).
the maximum reach of frontier control (maximum possible territorial control) is 180 days one-way distance (360 days round-trip) from the capital to the sector center with the fastest FTL drive available
the maximum reach of influence (beyond which a civilization cannot effectively influence a sector) is 360 days one-way distance (720 days round-trip) from the capital to the sector center with the fastest FTL drive available

e.g. the maximum tech level of Asteria is level 17, and the fastest FTL drives available are Hyperlane 2-6, Warp 6-1 and Jump 2-2. the most common type of FTL drive used is warp, so distances will be determined in terms of days of constant Warp 6-1 travel (7,776 c or 21.3 ly/day).

max reach of direct control - 2,556.5 ly
max reach of frontier control - 3,834.7 ly
max reach of influence - 7,669.5 ly

Spatial Matter - otherwise known as negative mass or exotic matter and created in ultrastability reactors from hydrogen, spatial matter dynamically attracts and repels space-time as needed, the core component in wormholes (min tech 24)
-- Tech 25-32 strategic materials --
Photonium - concentrated, self-attracting light, used for high-sensitivity radars and reflective-class shields, created in ultrastability reactors (min tech 25)
Neutral Matter - a third state of matter in contrast to matter and antimatter, neutral matter has mass but no reactive properties, only affected by high-power direct energy emission, which turns it into hydrogen and positronium, used in linear energy cannons, planet smashers, antimatter shields and other extreme WMDs (min tech 28)
-- Tech 32-40 strategic materials --
Computronium - a material capable of pure computation, made using quark assemblers and quantum boundary reactors, used in Matrioshka brains and smaller classes of super-brains (min tech 32)
Zero-Point Energy - vast amount of vacuum energy extracted by Omega Refineries tuned for exotic matter, used in all vacuum-energy devices as a core component, and as a massive power source for high-tier FTL drives. careless extraction may result in the formation of a false vacuum, which may cause enormous damage if accidentally triggered by an energy burst (min tech 33)
Tesseractial Carbon - a four-dimensional form of carbon, capable of making advanced spatio-electrical fields. made as a byproduct of polydimensional drives (min tech 37)

-- tech levels in general --
the year after the age name is merely for reference for a theoretical Earth-like technological development (there's absolutely nowhere in the known galaxy right now with tech 41!), absent of any events that would regress them
the names for tech levels above 32 is conjectural and based on expected trends (in lore)
1000 years per tech level is merely a placeholder, the periods between each tech level may be much higher or lower, some scientists theorize that the whole Multiversal Age may last only 100 years, and the Age of Ascension may take place in just 1 year
Beyond happening at tech 66+ is a very uncertain guess, it could be much higher or a lot lower, the only reference point is some transcendence crystals found while scavenging Khaldaarim ships!
for a "super-hard" no-FTL WotEG, disable all FTL drives and tachyonic STL drives, move Antimatter Thruster to tech 15, Luminal Thruster to 17 and Blueshift Thruster to 20, and max tech level is 25
once a new tier of FTL drive is invented, the tier below it receives one last upgrade to max level 9 (so a warp 5-6 drive at tech 16 can be upgraded to warp 5-9 at tech 17), making it useful for outdated ships that cannot accept higher-tier FTL drives but have enough power to support a higher-level FTL drive of the same tier
tech levels for ships are not actually hard limits; Frosthaven mostly uses huge, but low-tech (tech 14-15) ships in the 150K-200K tonne range, together with a small amount of high-tech (tech 17) ships in the 2000-5000 tonne range

-- Terraforming tech --

Terraforming I (Tech 12) can terraform planets 1-2 temp difference from ideal, and 1-2 atm difference from ideal, as well as introduce plant and animal life
Terraforming II (Tech 14) can terraform planets up to 3 temp difference from ideal, and 6 atm below and 3 atm above difference from ideal, Mars can be terraformed using Terraforming II
Terraforming III (Planetary Makeup) (Tech 18) can perform minor reconstructions of otherwise unsuitable planets, allowing cheaper and simpler terraforming methods to possibly be used, Venus can be terraformed using Terraforming III
Terraforming IV (Planetary Overhaul) (Tech 22) can reconstruct the crust and sometimes mantle of otherwise unsuitable planets, as well as shift planets into more favorable orbits, allowing cheaper methods to be used
Terraforming V (Planetary Reconstruction) (Tech 27) can totally rebuild planets to fix fatal issues that prevent any colonization in conjunction with cheaper terraforming methods
Terraforming VI (Planetary Design) (Tech 30) in theory can design ideal planets from scratch, even where there are no planets in the solar system. this is the peak of terraforming, as structures capable of housing a lot more people become available around this time
Terraforming VII (Stellar Genesis) (Tech 36) can create entire solar systems using enormous vacuum energy and energy-matter conversion, but massive improvements in habitation technology make this mostly a technology of scientific curiosity
Terraforming VIII (Galactosynthesis) (Tech 41) can create whole galaxies using vast quantities of zero-point power, at tech 41 it is only capable of making galaxies ~2,000 ly across, but by tech 45 it can make galaxies around Milky Way size (~150,000 ly)
Terraforming IX (Mini Universizer) (Tech 50) can create bubbles of altered reality, allowing a highly advantageous strategic position, or just safe research of differing universal conditions
Terraforming X (Reality Generator) (Tech 57) manipulates the basic framework of dimensionality to create anything from a new layer of reality to whole new universes, using unlimited energy
Terraforming Î© (Eternity Machine) (Age of Ascension) one of the discoveries that lead to the Ascension and eventually Beyond, the Eternity Machine can generate any level of universe, multiverse or any layerverse above them, any dimension and any reality imaginable, there is nothing beyond this
