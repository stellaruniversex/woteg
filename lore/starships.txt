--STARSHIPS OF THE KNOWN GALAXY--

Published by the Galactic Survey Agency annually
Last updated 32108 CE (684 Third Empire)
Note that the presence of some ships is tightly controlled by state governments, and accurate information may be scarce, or the only available information may be falsified to intimidate enemy states.
Ships are grouped by class (corvette -> frigate -> destroyer -> cruiser -> battlecruiser -> battleship -> dreadnought etc.) top to bottom.
Some ships have better FTL drives than their tech level should allow, these are mostly refined, more powerful examples of existing FTL drives, or unreliable prototypes which have been modified for regular usage.

-- CIVILIAN/PRIVATELY BUILT --
In addition to the extensive sets of military ships, there are numerous types of civilian ships, generally built privately by a manufacturing megacorporation. Most of them do not have the advanced shielding, weaponry or FTL drives of military ships, so they generally travel with escorts, either privately hired or assigned by the state government. They range in tech level from tech 12 to tech 17, the latter only produced at three starship factories galaxy-wide, and tech 18 prototypes have been recently unveiled.

Mark 1 Shuttle
The Mark 1 Shuttle is an easy to control and very inexpensive ship, used to train recruits in the art of basic starship control. In most Mark 1s, the FTL drive is omitted to further reduce costs, as they are not meant to travel to other systems.

Interexp cargo ship
The Interexp is the standard cargo ship in the Known Galaxy, enabling the quick restoration of ravaged post-Second Empire trade since its introduction in 247. When it was introduced, it was a cutting-edge ship that yet was cheap to produce, with a Warp 5 FTL drive and lightweight, agile design. In 684, there are more than 340 million registered galaxy-wide, and 24 million are produced every year.
In 652, two upgraded, more expensive variants were introduced: the Interexp Plus with a 150 ly FTL range, and the Interexp GTI with a Warp 5-3 warp drive.

Min docking port: Type III

Interexp II cargo ship
The Interexp II is a complete overhaul of the Interexp-class, first produced in 673 and featuring highly advanced tech 17 components, including shielding licensed from the Asterian government. The Interexp II is only produced at the ICSC Capilia factory at a rate of 5,000/year, to increase to 28,000/year by 690. In spite of this limited production, or perhaps because of it, the Interexp II is highly sought after, and the unit price increased from $600M when first introduced, to $2,355M today. Due to its much higher price, the Interexp II is only commonly found running highly lucrative trade routes.

Even though the stock Interexp II is already tough to find, the ICSC is planning to introduce a Turbo version, with a 275 ly FTL range and Warp 5-9 drive, in 685.

Blue Whale-class superheavy cargo ship
The Blue Whale-class is the heaviest starship that is known to be seriously developed, and not merely a concept, even heavier than some space stations. So far, the Blue Whale-class has been publicly seen as a set of prototype ships occassionally carrying extremely heavy loads, apparently to military bases for unknown top-secret projects, even though its introduction is scheduled for spring 698, around 14 years from now. The Blue Whale can only dock to type VIII ports, usually used for docking space stations together.

(editor's note, don't show to anyone!: the Blue Whale wouldn't be introduced until 706! it was also overbudget two-fold)

Traverser-class passenger ferry
The Traverser-class is a massive passenger and cargo ferry, the largest of its kind in the Known Galaxy. It has served well the major trade routes of the Known Galaxy since 566, with capacity for over 12,000 passengers and 15,000 t of cargo. Though considered a budget option, being overtaken by the newer Paradise-class, the Traverser-class remains a popular choice, enabling interstellar travel for those who couldn't normally afford to travel otherwise.

Factorium Minimum-class space manufactory
The Factorium Minimum standard factory is the first, smallest, and currently the only type of space-based starship factory in service in the Known Galaxy. It can produce sublight ships of up to 250 t, and is therefore used in systems where intrasystem ships are in such high demand that ground-based factories cannot produce enough without sacrificing other ship production. The Factorium Minimum is one of the few ships that is built solely in space, as opposed to nearly every other vessel, which are built on ground and transported by space elevator.

-- EMPIRE OF ASTERIA/THIRD EMPIRE --
Asteria's ships are relatively high-tech compared to most of the Known Galaxy, with ships of tech 15-17 being common. Compared to Khaldaar, Asterian ships are heavier and more balanced in their design, with shielding of roughly equal strength across the entire ship and a more conservative "trench war" strategy.

-- EMPIRE OF KHALDAAR --
Khaldaar's ships are the most advanced and fastest of any major faction, with ships of confimed tech levels up to 17, and even 18 if the claims of advanced leaked jump-capable ships are to be believed. Their ships mostly depend on powerful laser weapons and relativistic railguns, with a powerful frontal shield to repel even massive enemy fire, at the cost of the rest of the shielding. This means Khaldaarim ships depend either on hit-and-run attacks, or rapid-fire frontal destruction of enemy fleets, allowing them to defeat fleets twice their size, but making them very vulnerable to flank attacks. 

With no ability to properly defend against flanking attacks, Khaldaarim ships have very powerful thrusters to escape potential flanking attacks, and possibly turn them into a frontal attack much more suited to Khaldaarim military doctrine.

Yonthil-class jump cruiser
The Yonthil-class was spotted in a leak of high-tech Khaldaarim starship documents, and its existence is doubtful, due to the Khaldaarim tendency to fabricate ships more powerful than they actually have, to fool Asterian officials. However, they are plausible as some Khaldaar planets have tech 18.

-- FROSTHAVEN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC --
The ships of the Frosthaven People's Republic are mostly low-tech (tech 13-15), and are famous for being pre-fabricated from modular pieces, thus allowing Frosthaven to build bigger ships than any other known state, at about the same price as a comparable Asterian ship two size tiers lower, or a comparable Khaldaarim ship three size tiers lower. Frosthaven also uses a much smaller number of smaller, high-tech (tech 16-17) ships.

Frosthaven's ships use brute force firepower to overwhelm smaller fleets, and have very thick armor to compensate for relatively light shielding, meant only to protect from small asteroids. This comes at a heavy cost of flexibility, and even their thick armor can't sustain constant flanking attacks, the main method for countering Frosthaven's starship tactics. The main weapons are large-caliber (600mm and 1,000mm) sublight cannons and smaller 155mm railguns, as well as kinetic point defense, but the more advanced ships have laser point defense and relativistic missiles.

-- HAFURN REGENCY (heir to Second Empire) --
The Hafurn Regency claims to be the legitimate successor to the Empire of the Stars, or the Second Empire, which once ruled almost a tenth of the galaxy at its peak, and had tech levels as high as 29 (see STIL for more information), almost unimaginable by today's standards. The Hafurn Regency is a far cry from what the Second Empire was, but it still wields ships at tech levels as high as 19, more advanced than even the most advanced Khaldaar planets.
